â€œMaze Mapper" is a software application that allows users to solve and visualize mazes stored in the DOT format. 
This application can be used by anyone who needs to solve a maze and understand its underlying structure.

The program makes use of graph algorithms and data structures Dijkstra's algorithm, to find the shortest path through any maze. 
The DOT format is a plain text graph description language that is used to represent graphs.

When a user inputs a maze in DOT format, the program first reads and parses the file to create a graph representation of the maze. 
Then, the program applies the selected algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to the end of the maze. 
Finally, the program generates a visual representation of the maze, highlighting the shortest path found.

The visual representation of the maze can be helpful for users to understand the structure of the maze and how the algorithm found the shortest path. 
The program can also be used to compare the performance of different algorithms on the same maze or on different mazes.

Overall, "Maze Mapper" is a useful tool for anyone who needs to solve and understand the structure of a Dijkstra, from students to professionals in various fields.
